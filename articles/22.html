        Today, I open a door.<br />
        Tomorrow, the hunt begins.<br /><br />
        I become the hunted<br />
        and what came through becomes the hunter.<br /><br />
        I wonder how much influence<br />
        the man upstairs has in this.<br />
        Does he allow the hunt to happen?<br />
        Maybe it’s his entertainment.<br /><br />
        As long as I am under his roof<br />
        perhaps he permits the chase<br />
        because the chase is how I pay rent.<br /><br />
        I want to stop the hunt<br />
        so badly I don’t mind the price.<br />
        Yet it’s almost impossible.<br /><br />
        I close one door to keep the hunter out;<br />
        another opens<br />
        almost always.<br /><br />
        Sometimes I wonder whether I’m his prisoner<br />
        but what kind of prison feels this free?<br /><br />
        Maybe I’m alone, and the man upstairs<br />
        left this house for another.<br /><br />
        I do not know.
