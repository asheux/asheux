                        200 and seventy days plugged in,<br />
                        Maybe more, maybe less,<br />
                        But still, very much plugged,<br />
                        I remember not the song she sang me,<br />
                        Not a word she spoke,<br />
                        Sadly, not even the pain I caused her,<br />
                        It’s unclear and perhaps logically<br />
                        Implausible to have a total recall<br />
                        Of those experiences,<br />
                        Of what it feels to be her,<br />
                        To be with her.<br /><br />
                        Should I or not think about it?<br />
                        The moments we were one, a totality?<br />
                        Some agents. Ooh! Those invisible agents,<br />
                        Dare offer me the red or blue pill,<br />
                        Please! I know where those leads,<br />
                        Zion or bliss; nowhere,<br />
                        Nowhere close to those sweet little<br />
                        Me and her moments,<br />
                        Science gives me the concept of it,<br />
                        The gods haven’t tried,<br />
                        It’s just me and my memory now.<br /><br />
                        Take me back,<br />
                        Back to the moment when it all began,<br />
                        Let me feel your pain,<br />
                        Hear the songs,<br />
                        Comprehend your struggle,<br />
                        Let me be you,<br />
                        Smell you, kick you,<br />
                        Let me love you like you did<br />
                        The unconscious poor little me,<br />
                        Let me have the green pill.
