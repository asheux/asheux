        Lately, I've been exploring otherworlds,<br />
        Mostly the darkside with an absolute open mind,<br />
        Objectively, never to follow ideas in them to their birth.<br />
        Intrigued, I was,<br />
        By the nature of the darkside,<br />
        Which is contrary to the good old stories(GOS).<br />
        Determinism had me believe that in<br />
        The dark we find merely darkness,<br />
        Yet my encounters have been pure light.<br />
        Unexplored light which has nothing to<br />
        Shine on except the darkness.<br />
        The light is searching,<br />
        Looking for what most do; answers.<br />
        Questions, it has lots,<br />
        Doubts plenty,<br />
        But mostly, questions with potential uncertainties.<br />
        Some worlds are unknowingly naive,<br />
        but most are self-aware like many<br />
        who see the light In its true nature.<br />
        Imprisoned by ignorance, they are.<br />
        If I could break them out, I would,<br />
        But what use am I, when I am a prisoner myself?<br />
        Luckily, I got one question answered,<br />
        There is less uncertainties in the dark<br />
        And more in the light.
