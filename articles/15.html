        We are voyagers, traveling to<br />
        a distant unknown place.<br />
        Onboard a ship designed with<br />
        everything there is to satisfy our ideals,<br />
        and keep us safe.<br />
        It consumes our poor bodies,<br />
        but never our minds.<br />
        Our minds, and its own become<br />
        one with only a single objective;<br />
        to evolve and get to the otherside;<br />
        to be amongst the stars.<br />
        Our ship is in a war of existence.<br />
        It’s only way to ensure survival is<br />
        to evolve Intelligent life.<br />
        So, in a sense, we are all chosen.<br />
        Chosen to take us home.<br />
        But then again remember,<br />
        it has a way to rid the weaker minds<br />
        by a concept familiar to us.<br />
        It’s only logical, and perhaps rational<br />
        for every mind to strive to become<br />
        one with the Whole.<br />
        Monsters have been here,<br />
        and more yet to come.<br />
        Their agenda; to seek and destroy.<br />
        The ship is the target because it holds the key; us.<br />
        Asteroids, ‘black holes’, name them.<br />
        But they are just a reminder to voyagers,<br />
        That our little daily problems are nothing compared<br />
        To that which the Whole has to endure.<br />
        It is by no chance we are connected,<br />
        Neither is it by choice.<br />
        Take a moment, and save yourself, then<br />
        the Whole will save us.
