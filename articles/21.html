        The question of the existence of God or gods has puzzled many for
        millennia; from scientists, philosophers, theologians to ordinary humans
        like myself but no one, at least to my knowledge, has come close to a
        definitive answer.
        <br /><br />
        In this article, I would like to consider how I would approach this
        query. Let’s consider the question of free will. This article would
        assume we both know what free will is or understand what it’s meant by
        free will.<br /><br />
        Let’s start with an analogy. I will give you two worlds, let’s call them
        1 and 2. In world 1, there exists no God and all agents living in this
        world have free will. Agents living in world 1 have all the freedom to
        do whatever they want with no God or gods to judge them and certainly no
        feeling of guilt. Things, however, are different in world 2 because in
        this world, there is a God who can intervene in every agent’s daily
        lives upon being summoned or given a request, and everyone lacks free
        will. The life of an agent in the second world is deterministic and
        predictable. At this point, if I asked you to choose which world you
        would go for, you certainly would choose the former. Suppose then I
        added some more conditions. For instance, in world 1, the agents have
        been offered a certain amount of time by whoever put them in their world
        and abandoned them, so to speak. They have time to which they can use to
        spend it however they desire by creating a life for themselves but with
        one disclaimer; merely that the time they spend and anything that comes
        out of the spent time is and will be pointless. It will be a waste when
        they have lived their entire lives and died. Perhaps this will scare
        some from choosing this world. Certainly, not all of them and not more
        of them, only a few.<br /><br />
        In the second world, despite having a God and being a non free world, it
        offers great opportunities and potential to grow. You have the same time
        allocated to you as in world 1 but unlike in the first, the agents use
        their time simply to fulfill a certain objective. They are to use their
        time wisely because in the end, there is judgment in the sense that you
        are punished for failing and rewarded for succeeding. Reward is given
        only if you reached the goal that your creator put forth for you.
        Mostly, the goal is not known beforehand. The agents have to figure out
        what that is. This, of course, poses more problems and danger of failing
        to reach the goal. Think of it like a game or a puzzle in this
        hypothetical world in the sense that for you to reach a goal, you have
        to have solved the puzzle successfully. The puzzle master rewards those
        who successfully solve the puzzle and the most familiar reward we might
        guess is to give your personality back to you when you die or what most
        people call consciousness. Your consciousness is taken to another better
        world with even more fascinating puzzles than the ones you’ve solved. A
        theologian would call this an afterlife. And remember, this does not
        exist in world 1; a Godless, free world.<br /><br />
        One would argue, world 2 certainly is more interesting than world 1
        which, clearly, is very boring, in my opinion. This, of course, would
        mean we have to define what we mean by boring here. My boring sense of
        the world is considering the fact that in world 2, things are more
        interesting because of their nature of being mysterious. For example,
        the puzzle nature of the world makes it so that if you are an agent in
        this world, you will have to question everything you encounter whether
        it’s part of the puzzle to be solved or not. Isn’t that so interesting?
        But compared to world 1, where ignorance seems to play a big part in
        crippling the system since after all nothing matters in the end.<br /><br />
        With these in mind, one would consider our own world and ask whether we
        live in the first or the second world. One would argue we are in world 1
        because of the evil that exists in our own world and because by my
        analogy, evil would only exist in a free, godless world otherwise no one
        would be doing evil knowing the punishment which awaits them when they
        die. According to this, we can say our world is a free, godless world.
        But another would argue, why then do we have such mysteries like
        consciousness, intelligence, space, time and all other phenomena we
        cannot explain? Because if we remember our hypothetical world 2, these
        phenomena only exist in a non-free, Godful world. This poses a greater
        problem in discerning whether our world is world 1 or world 2.
        <br /><br />
        Suppose we decided that our world is indeed world 2. Well, this will
        force us into a very difficult position of proving the existence of God,
        because; where is he? Maybe we are just discovering these mysteries now
        since he’s gone and left us or because he was never there in the first
        place. Or maybe all this time we’ve just been living ignorantly in the
        free, Godless world without realizing it. Then after we gained
        sentience, we figured out we can use these unexplored mysteries to
        understand our world and perhaps use that understanding to prolong our
        lives and make a meaning for ourselves. And if we survive long enough,
        figure out the key to living forever in this Godless free world. Well,
        that’s possible but the really hard question for you is; which world
        would you choose, a Godless free world or Godfull non-free world?
