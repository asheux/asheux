        In the sea of the unknown;<br />
        With no answers except questions;<br />
        I have no memory of why and how I got here;<br />
        Threatening is the sea water;<br />
        To suck life out of me, it shall;<br />
        Unless I catch one of the two boats,<br />
        the Real or the Other; the Real;<br />
        Which would potentially save me from destruction;<br />
        I am aware that the boat I choose will lead me to<br />
        an unknown yet desired destination,<br />
        or to destruction;<br />
        The Real and the Other are very much alike,<br />
        With no labels to tear them apart;<br />
        For the Real might as well be the Other<br />
        And the Other as the Real;<br />
        Perhaps, I can try tomorrow;<br />
        But where shall I rest my vessel when<br />
        the islands are as threatening as the sea water?<br />
        Luckily, I found a temporary resting place;<br />
        Not far from the sea and not so far from the island;<br />
        The very island, unmistakably, named the building;<br />
        It is only safer here because the bullets fired<br />
        from the watchtower on the island cannot reach me,<br />
        So is the threatening sea water;<br />
        It is not clear how long my safe spot will last;<br />
        Certainly, not clear how much time I still have<br />
        before I can find and catch the Real;<br />
        The strangers, whom I have no concrete<br />
        interaction with, merely communicate through<br />
        the signs and symbols which they obscurely convey;<br />
        Incomprehensible to this poor little machine<br />
        in my skull, they are; to ignore them, I shall not;<br />
        I stand still and observe with uncertainties as the<br />
        only armor I have against the forces I cannot control;<br />
        And this poor little machine as the only tool<br />
        to help me find the Real;<br />
        What is the Real?
