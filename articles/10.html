        There is a World out there<br />
        Fascinating, and absolutely beautiful,<br />
        Many are aware of it’s existence<br />
        yet only a few have reached,<br />
        I wonder,<br />
        how much pleasant could this World be?<br />
        To the point that it takes<br />
        only a few to get there<br />
        The chosen ones,<br />
        The beauty and nature of<br />
        this World is a mystery,<br />
        One that has probed curiosity within us<br />
        I am not there yet<br />
        but I am in desperate need of it,<br />
        Time is moving fast and with it,<br />
        it carries my youth,<br />
        I do not want it to take a wasteful youth<br />
        But instead, a fulfilling one<br />
        Because it’s never coming back,<br />
        Today, I am alive again<br />
        I have no knowledge of tomorrow,<br />
        Only hope<br />
        Hope that tomorrow a new World will<br />
        unfold right before my eyes<br />
        The very eyes that have failed me<br />
        in seeing the hidden World.
