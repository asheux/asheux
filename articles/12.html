                        What are dreams? What role do they play in our lives? When you say
                        you had a dream, what does that mean to you? Do you sit back and
                        think about this dream or do you assume it’s just one of the tricks
                        your unconscious mind does to clear the unwanted, the unfathomable?
                        These are philosophical questions and the question of what dreams
                        are is quite interesting.<br /><br />
                        In my early ages as a young boy, I had a dream. Not once, not twice
                        but many times. It was the dream of flying. Well, as many of you
                        would think, such an experience is one beautiful and fascinating in
                        its sense, why not visit that world again. That’s exactly how I felt
                        and to me this dream had no meaning at all other than just a dream.
                        <br /><br />
                        As a boy I could not question such experiences like anyone with
                        understanding would, assuming they know what understanding means.
                        Later on, as I gained a little bit of understanding, I began to be
                        self-aware — so I think. I started to see the world around me in
                        this timeline and the world to come as not much different from
                        the world in my unconscious mind.<br /><br />
                        There have been questions on the internet whether human beings would
                        be able to create such a thing as an intelligent machine and flying
                        vehicles, these are the topics these days. Well, I’m not educated in
                        this area but it’s okay to speculate. My speculation is there would
                        be such a being or in a more general term, world, in the coming times.
                        It’s an interesting and beautiful world to think about if you ask me.

                        What does intelligence in these contexts mean? Well, let’s do a thought
                        experiment. The Universe as the scientists have discovered created what
                        we now know as Evolution. Evolution created one of the most complex beings,
                        us, human beings. If you think about it, it is a process. Now, a question
                        would arise, what then have humans created? There is technology. But is
                        that all there is? Well, think about it.<br /><br />
                        One of the most, if not, The most interesting topics in the world of technology
                        is Artificial Intelligence(AI). The idea that we as humans can create something
                        or someone that thinks, acts and has the same experiences as we do. One would
                        ask, will these beings have an experience like dreaming as my young or every
                        humans’ soul does? Assuming there is such a thing as a soul — I think there is.
                        The answer is, we’ll see.<br /><br />
                        What about understanding? Well, as Roger Penrose puts it in the, Intelligence is
                        something that needs understanding. Does it mean then that until we build a
                        machine that has understanding, we cannot think of such an entity as intelligent?
                        I will leave that to you the creators of AI.<br /><br />
                        <h4>Final Words</h4>
                        This is my dream and a city I want to live in, it’s one we all want to be in.
                        But how do we get there?
