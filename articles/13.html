                        ou and I are merely ideas in the universe,<br />
                        First contact, I seem to know little<br />
                        About you, and you as I,<br />
                        But what then is the I<br />
                        That which perceives the you,<br />
                        if not the I that knows you.<br /><br />
                        I perceive you as you do I,<br />
                        To think that little is known about you to I,<br />
                        is but an illogical conclusion,<br />
                        The perception of you is merely what’s within I,<br />
                        As you perceive I what’s within in itself.<br /><br />
                        It is beauty,<br />
                        It is happiness,<br />
                        It is intelligence,<br />
                        It is peace,<br />
                        And it is all but evil,<br />
                        That which I perceive within you.<br /><br />
                        The idea of you and I,<br />
                        That which the universe intelligently designed,<br />
                        now makes total sense to me,<br />
                        Because I cannot exist without<br />
                        the subjective experience of you.
