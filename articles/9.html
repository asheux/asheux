                        Certainly, my conscious experiences<br />
                        have no limit. So I thought,<br />
                        Could be the sky,<br />
                        Could be the other side,<br />
                        Perhaps, It could be my own undoing,<br />
                        But no, it is the observer,<br />
                        A bold claim you would say, but what if?<br /><br />
                        The space is vast,<br />
                        My curiosity like that of a child,<br />
                        But only familiarity I see amid my<br />
                        explorations,<br />
                        Strangely, the followers are the only<br />
                        Strangers with the same uncertainty as mine,<br />
                        My perception is far greater than my being<br />
                        Yet what I can touch is only limited<br />
                        By the walls. Which with motives,<br />
                        Blocks me from the other side.<br /><br />
                        It’s pretty out there,<br />
                        It could be deceit by my own eyes,<br />
                        Which contradicts with my own<br />
                        Beliefs about reality,<br />
                        Is what’s within the walls<br />
                        the only reality in my reach?<br />
                        Is what’s beyond not real at all?<br />
                        It’s quite illogical to infer<br />
                        that which is out of my reach as illusory,<br />
                        Because they are real,<br />
                        Real as the processes in my mind.<br /><br />
                        Am I a prisoner in my own mind?<br />
                        Or is my mind a prisoner to something else;<br />
                        The observer?
