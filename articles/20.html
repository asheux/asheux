        When faced with the question of the existence of God, I take the time to
        think about how well or perhaps satisfactory the approach I would take
        to answer such an inquiry could be. The question of God’s existence
        really is an important and very interesting one to think about for
        reasons that are so obvious because how then can one approach such a
        profound question without actually having a definitive answer to it.
        Suppose I, as an observer or a person interested in finding God’s place
        in my life or in any other person's life, am faced with such a
        question.<br /><br />
        First I will have to consider so many variables that will argue for and
        against His/Her/Its existence. For instance, if I claim that there is a
        God, whether personal or not, I will put myself in a state that requires
        me to address the question why there is evil and suffering in the world.
        Because if indeed God exists, he would not, I think, permit such evil to
        exist since it has been said that he is a perfect being. But one would
        then argue that the existence of evil is God’s way of testing the
        freedom he has given to his people or what most call free will.<br /><br />
        Suppose we then shift our thoughts to the claim of his non-existence. In
        this state, one would be forced to answer the question of why the
        universe exists and everything in it. Because how could such a complex
        and beautiful thing exist without an Intelligent Designer. There, in
        principle, has to be a cause for everything to come to being. But the
        real question if there is a God is how does this powerful being feel
        about the doubts we as the result of their creation have toward their
        existence. It surely makes them feel undermined.
        <br /><br />
        Let’s assume I am one of those who believe in the existence of such a
        being as God. Then I will have to prove his existence or provide
        evidence of his interaction with the world. This is another interesting
        question to consider because God’s interaction to the world God created
        is fundamental to the question of free will because how free are the
        occupants of this world if now and then there is a benevolent being
        changing the state of the world?
