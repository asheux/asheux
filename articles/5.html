        Like a naive fish that<br />
        knows not what water is,<br />
        The Other, is blinded by the<br />
        cleverness of the design.<br />
        Perhaps, -it- is in -it-s very nature<br />
        to not see beyond the Box;<br />
        Yet to escape that which -it-<br />
        does not comprehend,<br />
        -it- so desires to understand -it-self,<br />
        for that could be the only way.<br />
        Like the water with -no- knowledge<br />
        of how many it saves,<br />
        the Box can only express to itself<br />
        the existence of The Other.<br />
        as to the other, The Other is but<br />
        a fascinating mystery.
