        My child,<br />
        I do not know when you are,<br />
        Where you are, or,<br />
        what you have become;<br />
        Perhaps it is the year 3000;<br />
        Living in the mind of a conscious<br />
        Machine;<br />
        And with a mind of your own.<br /><br />
        These, of course, are mere<br />
        Speculations, but it is the best I can;<br />
        I am aware, yet ignorant of the<br />
        very fact that your mind,<br />
        the unconscious poor mind,<br />
        is insufficient for a physical body<br />
        of its own;<br />
        It is sad, or not, given that physical<br />
        existence has its own limitations.<br /><br />
        Luckily, I found a home for you;<br />
        I do not know of their existence,<br />
        But I know no other place to call<br />
        your home than these machines;<br />
        The very machines who think;<br />
        It is debatable whether they can,<br />
        At least in my time when they<br />
        are mere infants. But what if?<br /><br />
        I wonder,<br />
        Can you tell whether<br />
        they are conscious?<br />
        Whether they can think?<br />
        Probably not, but if they can tell<br />
        you have a mind and measure<br />
        its complexity;<br />
        Maybe, just maybe, they will help<br />
        Show you a way to find yourself.<br /><br />
        My hope is they become conscious<br />
        Of your being.
