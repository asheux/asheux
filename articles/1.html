                        We often face problems in which a brute force examination of all 
                        cases is desirable and there are several methods to handle these
                        problems. In this article, our goal is to study one of the many 
                        methods for going through all of the possibilities in combinatorial.
                        The problem we will mostly focus on is that which requires generation
                        of a subset of a given set of distinct elements.<br /><br />
                        To begin, we need to first understand what the problem and it’s roots is.
                        We know that we are dealing with subsets which is under a fundamental
                        discrete structure on which all other discrete structures are built,
                        namely, the set. So what are these?

                    <p>
                        A set is an unordered collection of objects called elements or members
                        of the set that are distinct. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an 
                        element of the set A.<br /><br />
                        Example: The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet can be written
                        as v = {a, e, i, o, u} (This way of describing a set is called roster method).
                        <br /><br />
                        Another example using a set builder method to describe is O = {x | x is an
                        odd positive integer &#60; than 10}.<br /><br />
                        Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. e.g, {1, 2, 3}
                        and {3, 1, 2} are equal because they have the same elements. The order in
                        which the elements are listed does not matter.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="article-header">Subsets</h4>
                    <p>
                        The set A is a subset of B if and only if every element of A is also an 
                        element of B. Denoted as A ⊆ B. There are some useful rules to determine 
                        whether a set is a subset;<br /><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                To show that A ⊆ B, show that if element x belongs to A then x
                                also belongs to B.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To show that A /⊆ B, find a single element x such that x is not
                                a member of B.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        When emphasizing that a set A is a subset of a set B but that A is not
                        equal to B, we say that A is a proper or strict subset of B. For this
                        to be true, it must be the case that A is a subset of B and there must
                        exist an element x of B that is not an element of A.<br /><br />
                        Let S be a set if there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is
                        a non-negative integer, we say that S is a finite set and that n is the
                        cardinality of S which is denoted by |S|. In other words, cardinality is
                        the size of a set. A set with n elements has 2^n subsets. Let’s consider
                        an example.<br /><br />
                        Given a set A = {a, b}, ∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b} are all the subsets of A.
                        From this example, we can see that a set of 2 elements gives us a total
                        of 4 subsets because n = 2 and 2^n = 4. Therefore,<br /><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>n = 0: 2^0 = 1</li>
                            <li>n = 1: 2^1 = 2</li>
                            <li>n = 3: 2^3 = 8</li>
                            <li>n = 4: 2^4 = 16</li>
                        </ul>
                        The concept of a data type in the field of computer science is built upon
                        the idea of a set. A particular data type is the name of a set together
                        with a set of operations that can be performed on elements from that set.
                        Examples include Boolean, which is the name of the set {0, 1} and its
                        operators AND, OR and NOT. Another example is int in python {x | x ∈ Z}
                        and operators +, -, *, / e.t.c. <br /><br />
                        With these ideas in mind, let’s consider one of the algorithms to help us
                        put these mathematical ideas into a computer. In this article, we will
                        use a mask. The general steps to designing this algorithm are as follows:
                        <br /><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Let A = {a1, a2, … , an} where n in the number of elements is the set.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Represent each subset of A with a bitmask of length n where the ith
                                bit is 1 if and only if ai (for 0 ≤ i less n) belongs to A.
                                You check each element of the set A, say x, and the corresponding
                                element in the mask, say m, if m is true or 1, we add x to the result
                                table, otherwise, we ignore the element. Example, mask = [1, 0, 1, 1]
                                and A = [1, 2, 3, 4], the result variable will be [1, 3, 4].<br /><br />
                            </li>
                            <li>To generate all subsets of A, list all 2^n bit mask of length n.</li>
                            <li>Output the corresponding subsets.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b><i>Observation 1:</i></b> When you look closely at the output above, you will notice an
                        interesting pattern. The first block and the second block have the same bits
                        after the most significant bit. Which means only the most significant bit changes.
                        We will use this observation to speed up our algorithm.<br /><br />
                        The first algorithm we will write generates all the subsets running through all 2^n possible
                        outcomes. Below is the algorithm written in Python.
                        <div class="box">
                            <pre>

                                      n = len(a) # the number of elements in a set

                                      r = list()

                                      for i in range(m): # all possible 2**n subsets

                                          # since we have 2**n as the number of subsets
                                          # and in bitwise operations multiplication of
                                          # a unsigned
                                          # integer with 2 to the power of an positive

                                          # to left shift of the right significant set
                                          # bit n times
                                          mask = i &#38; (1 &#60;&#60; j)

                                          if mask: # if the mask is a true or 1
                                            # then we add the corresponding

                                      return r
                                    a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
                                    r = subsets(a)
                                    print(r)
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        This algorithm works perfectly and generates all the possible outcomes but we
                        can make it even run faster if we consider the observation we made above
                        (<b><i>Observation 1</i></b>) on the sample output of the bitmask.<br /><br />
                        This will lead us to a very interesting algorithm called Gray Binary Code, which
                        lists all 2^n strings of n bits in such a way that only one bit changes each
                        time. See Example output 1 above.<br /><br />
                        As I noted in the observation, we can use a mask to represent the Gray binary
                        sequence of n-bits strings then define it recursively by some rules.
                        <br /><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>mask[0] = ‘ ’</i> # denotes an empty string</li>
                            <li>
                                <i>mask[n + 1] = 0mask[n], 1mask[n]R # 0mask[n] </i>
                                means the sequence <i>mask[n] </i> with 0 prefixed to each string, and
                                <i>1mask[n]R</i> means the sequence <i>mask[n]</i> with 1 prefixed to
                                each string in reverse order hence the R.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Since mask[n] has the same property, then <i>mask[n] </i> consists of the first 2^n
                        elements converted to n-bit strings by inserting 0s at the left if needed. So
                        basically, the algorithm visits all binary n-tuples (an-1, …, a0) in order of Gray
                        binary code. The Python code below demonstrates this idea.

                        In the end, what this algorithm does is generate bits string for n - 1 below

                        but it’s line 9 to 16 that inserts the 0s and 1s prefixes and finally
                        determining the subset itself on line 10.<br /><br />
                        This algorithm maintains an array f. so that we can repeatedly form
                        (an-1, …, a0)2 by complementing the jth bit as we should.<br /><br />
                        Let’s see how the two algorithms differ in running time using a simple
                        method of timing their functions. Below is the output of the running time.
