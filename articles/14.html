                        Let’s begin with the question ‘what is a permutation and lexicographic?’.
                        It’s a two in one question. Suppose you have three distinct balls in
                        color — red, green and blue and you want to arrange them in all possible
                        ways so that every new arrangement is different from the previous output
                        as in the following image.<br /><br />
                        <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <img width="150px" height="300px" src="/images/lexico.png" />
                        </div>
                        This is in some sense, permutation. In mathematics terms, it is the arrangement
                        of elements of a set in a sequence. Lexicographic, on the other hand, is the
                        generation of the way words are alphabetically ordered based on the alphabetical
                        order of their component letters(borrowed from
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order">Wikipedia</a> ).
                        <br /><br />
                        In this article, our focus is not on the theoretical part of these terms but
                        rather on the practical bit and how they can be generated using algorithms in
                        computer science.<br /><br />
                        The concept of lexicographic generation is an interesting topic in combinatorics
                        and we will look at how to generate them here. When generating permutations in
                        lexicographical order, there are few things we need to keep in mind.<br /><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of distinct objects — balls in our case above (n).</li>
                            <li>The number of permutations to generate, which is n factorial (n!).</li>
                            <li>
                                For the lexicographical order, given two sequence of the same length n,
                                a1, a2, …, an and b1, b2, … , bn. The first one is smaller than the second,
                                if ai &#60; bi (for 0 ≤ i &#60; n) for the first i where ai and bi are
                                different members of the sequence.<br /><br />
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        With this in mind, let’s write an algorithm for this idea using one of the higher
                        level programming languages (Python). We are going to write two algorithms. One
                        will be a simple, less efficient and the second will be an elegant and faster
                        version of the first. We’ll see how to analyze the two in terms of time complexity.
                        <br /><br />
                        We start with the first classical method for generating all permutations, visiting
                        them in lexicographical order. We have n elements in a sequence {a1, a2, …, an}
                        initially sorted so that a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … an.<br /><br />
                        The algorithm will use {ABCD} as our test case. And a function name; lexicographic_perms()
                        for the first algorithm and elexicographic_perms() for the second algorithm.<br /><br />

                        zero indexing. If aj ≥ aj+1, we decrease j by 1 until j can satisfy
                        aj &#60; aj+1. if j &#60; 0 that means we have visited all permutations

                        At this point we have a complete algorithm that correctly generates all n! permutations
                        in lexicographical order. Note, section 2 has the same output as section 1.

                        Finally, let’s check how much faster does the second algorithm run. Based on the following
                        output, we can infer that algorithm 2 is two times faster than algorithm 1. This is due
                        to the observation we made earlier that j = last - 1 is performed half of the time,
                        that is n!/2.<br /><br />
