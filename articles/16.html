        Hello!<br />
        Are you out there?<br />
        Can you see it?<br />
        The beauty, the magnificence, the elegance,<br />
        The balance, the brilliance.<br />
        Can you feel it?<br />
        The air on your skin, which is fundamentally part of it.<br />
        For a while i’ve been trying to reach you,<br />
        Tell you all about the world inside this cave, my world.<br />
        In here, it’s quiet, peaceful, and dangerous.<br />
        Almost as if there’s nothing at all,<br />
        Yet everything seems so real.<br />
        All these entities I see, feel, touch, and<br />
        Perhaps engage in deep conversations<br />
        About events happening around us.<br />
        Events that, in a sense, are all<br />
        non deterministic, and unpredictable,<br />
        All of whom/which my unconscious mind<br />
        cannot comprehend.<br />
        They are strangers in my mind.<br />
        I like them, in fact, I love them or if you like;<br />
        I give them love, which is one of the entities<br />
        I haven’t quite come to terms with,<br />
        Well, because it puzzles me.<br />
        Not because of its mysterious nature but<br />
        Because it’s so simple yet so complex.<br />
        My RTC is broken.<br />
        Can you fix it?<br />
        I know you can.<br />
        Let’s talk over it, shall we?<br />
        And maybe, just maybe, we can figure out<br />
        A way to see again.<br />
        Then I can show you my world and,<br />
        You can show me yours.
