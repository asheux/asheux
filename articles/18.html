                        The void I so want to fill<br />
                        With nothing or something<br />
                        I do not understand.<br />
                        It could be that the void exits<br />
                        Because I myself make it so.<br />
                        Perhaps something else takes away<br />
                        The things that make I whole.<br />
                        So that I shall not see what<br />
                        Is hidden from I.<br /><br />
                        In the absence of such a thing<br />
                        That takes from I,<br />
                        Then it must be that I alone<br />
                        unconsciously gives away the<br />
                        Things dear to I.<br />
                        The very things that fill the void.<br />
                        Whether these things are replaceable,<br />
                        I do not know.<br /><br />
                        I wonder,<br />
                        What then shall I consume in order<br />
                        To make it so that I shall not unconsciously<br />
                        Lose that which makes I whole?<br />
                        It is clear to I that such a thing exists,<br />
                        Yet existence of it is far from the<br />
                        Perception of I.<br /><br />
                        But to find that which the empty vessel<br />
                        Seeks, I shall have to open the very<br />
                        Eyes that sees the hidden<br />
                        And forever shall I never lack consciousness.
