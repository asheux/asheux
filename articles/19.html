        Some people seem so certain of the so-called afterlife; that there is a
        life beyond this one we all share. How can such certainty exist in our
        minds if its possibility is far from proven? I do not critique the
        concept of an afterlife but instead, I am considering the possibility of
        its non-existence. But suppose there is such a thing as an afterlife,
        what would be the implication? What will life mean to us?
        <br /><br />
        Let’s consider, for instance, that there is a God or gods, who are
        working together to make sure everyone who deserves to have another
        life, has it. Then would that make Him or them in control of this life
        that we are living currently.<br /><br />
        Well, I do not know but I feel that might be the case. If not directly,
        then they or he must be an active participant in our world. Now let me
        get to the view that there is life after death and to the view that I
        believe in; that life is computational and we are living in a computable
        machine that is always predicting and guessing what to put into our
        perception based on our computation. This view(the view that we are
        living in a computer simulation) was put forward by Nick Bostrom in the
        simulation argument. I might be inclined to suggest that we consider
        every other event that happens in our lives because they may most
        certainly be relevant to our daily routine more than we are aware of. So
        if there is life after death and life as we know it is a sort of
        simulation that God or gods are running, then it is possible that the
        only machine that is connected to the world outside our own, where the
        gods live, is the brain and it’s the only devices that is the bridge
        between our world and theirs.<br /><br />
        I am making this claim based on our current understanding of how our
        brains work and it is said that the brain controls almost everything
        that happens around us or in us. Suppose with this information we take
        the brain as the center of the universe and focus on how to decode it or
        hack it, would that give us access to the other worlds which are
        intentionally, I think, obscured from our own comprehensible percepts.
        The answer; I do not know. Some people believe it is. I certainly do
        believe in this idea. The only question that will stand, for the
        believers, is; how then can one hack the brain and potentially have that
        amazing and revolutionary contact with the gods or God? And does God or
        gods want us to do that? Are there consequences to doing so? It is
        impossible and so painful to think that life could exist just randomly,
        that I exist by a random chance. How could that be? I cannot think of an
        explanation to suppose that to be true. I think that something or
        someone put us here and whatever that thing is, it is watching our every
        move. Whether that will get one in trouble of changing another person's
        mind or affecting the state of the environment, I do not know but it’s
        an interesting idea to pursue and think about.
        <br /><br />
        If studying the brain and its functions will answer these questions,
        then we as humans have a long way to go in understanding this very
        machine we cannot predict. One area of study that I have been so keen to
        follow is consciousness and its purpose for evolving. I don’t entirely
        know what it means but the main reason I am interested is to find out
        what it is and whether it’s something that is separate from me or part
        of me. What makes me conscious, for instance? Is it the experiences I
        have every day or there is something about consciousness that is much
        bigger.
