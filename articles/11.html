                        The nature of the universe and the doubts in my mind<br />
                        Are fascinating,<br />
                        I think of everything in the former to be the<br />
                        Cause of understanding the latter,<br />
                        My perception of the former has in doubt led me<br />
                        To the latter and thereafter, provoked my way of thinking.<br /><br />
                        I know not what to make of real,<br />
                        Reality has, to me, become a realm of questions,<br />
                        What is real?<br />
                        What is love in the realm of the universe?<br />
                        Is there more to the physical world, the tangible?<br />
                        These inquiries and more led me to reality.<br /><br />
                        The philosophy of love,<br />
                        The question of, what is it, has in fact led me<br />
                        To the answers I seek,<br />
                        A soul in the universe,<br />
                        Within the body of the physical world.<br /><br />
                        A soul that makes the world within me real,<br />
                        If happiness is real,<br />
                        Doubts real,<br />
                        Universe real,<br />
                        Love real,<br />
                        I real,<br />
                        Then, she is real.<br /><br />
                        The true definition of love exists within her,<br />
                        An idea which to me has been a mystery,<br />
                        A mystery that a single soul with perfection,<br />
                        and imperfection within, helped solve,<br />
                        To both, I can now with no doubts say I understand.
