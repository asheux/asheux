Like a naive fish that
knows not what water is,
The Other, is blinded by the
cleverness of the design.
Perhaps, -it- is in -it-s very nature
to not see beyond the Box;
Yet to escape that which -it-
does not comprehend,
-it- so desires to understand -it-self,
for that could be the only way.
Like the water with -no- knowledge
of how many it saves,
the Box can only express to itself
the existence of The Other.
as to the other, The Other is but
a fascinating mystery.
