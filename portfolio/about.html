                <p>
                    Brian Mboya is a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.soap-bx.com/">Soapbox Inc.</a>
                    He studied computer science at <a href="https://www.dkut.ac.ke/">DeKUT University</a> in Kenya.
                    He is a volunteer at <a href="https://trendinafrica.org">TReND</a>,
                    teaching African scientist the Python programming language to help them use programming in their
                    research and application of machine learning techniques. He attended summer school
                    for <a href="https://trendinafrica.org/computational-neuroscience-basics/">
                        Computational Neuroscience and Machine learning basics</a> by <a href="https://trendinafrica.org">TReND
                    </a> in Accra, Ghana.
                    He is scheduled to attend the <a href="https://imbizo.africa/">IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo
                    </a> by <a href="https://imbizo.africa/">Imbizo Africa</a>.

                <h4>Interests</h4>
                <p>
                    I am fascinated by the human brain and how it works. My fascination with the brain grew as 
                    a result of studying computation in machine. My interest is to understand how the brain works
                    computationally, and my main area of study is attention, specifically visual attention in both
                    humans and animals. This is in hopes the studying attention will gives us clues to how, where
                    and why consciousness emerges in the brain.<br /><br />
                    My research questions include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is visual attention fundamental to memory retention?</li>
                        <li>
                            Is there any correlation between visual attention and attention required
                            to complete a cognitive task?
                        </li>
                        <li>What is the neural correlate of attention?</li>
                        <li>And how does attention relate to dreams?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
