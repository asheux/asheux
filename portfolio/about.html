    <h4>Short bio</h4>
    <p>
      I am a Senior Software Engineer at
      <a href="https://www.soap-bx.com/">Soapbox Inc.</a> and an Affiliate
      Researcher at the
      <a href="https://wolframinstitute.org/">Wolfram Institute</a>. I studied
      computer science at
      <a href="https://www.dkut.ac.ke/">DeKUT University</a> in Kenya. I'm also
      a volunteer at <a href="https://trendinafrica.org">TReND</a>, teaching
      African scientist the Python programming language to help them use
      programming in their research and application of machine learning
      techniques. In June, 2023, I attended summer school for
      <a href="https://trendinafrica.org/computational-neuroscience-basics/">
        Computational Neuroscience and Machine learning basics</a
      >
      by <a href="https://trendinafrica.org">TReND </a> in Accra, Ghana. In 7th
      Jan 2024, I attended another summer school for the same field:
      <a href="https://imbizo.africa/archive/2024/">
        IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo
      </a>
      by <a href="https://imbizo.africa/">Imbizo Africa</a> in Noordhoek, Cape
      Town, South Africa. And just recently, 17th June 2024, I attended a 3
      weeks
      <a href="https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school">
        Wolfram Summer School 2024 </a
      >. See below for all the summer schools

    <h4>Interests</h4>
    <p>
      I am fascinated by the human brain and how it works. My fascination with
      the brain grew as a result of studying computation in machine. My interest
      is to understand how the brain works computationally, and my main area of
      study is attention and memory, specifically visual attention in both
      humans and animals. This is in hopes that studying attention will give us
      clues to how, where and why consciousness emerges in the brain.
    </p>
    <p>My research questions include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How is visual attention related to memory retention?</li>
      <li>How does attention affect working memory in humans?</li>
      <li>
        Is there any correlation between visual attention and attention required
        to complete a cognitive task?
      </li>
      <li>What is the neural correlates of attention?</li>
      <li>And, how does attention relate to dreams?</li>
    </ul>
